# The-Bin-Project-2


My second project with the bin. This time Heidi is picking the project.
This is what she said: as a raccoon, i'd build a smart temperature-controlled light display where the LED matrix shows different colors based on the temperature measured by the thermistor, with the neopixel LED acting as a visual indicator for when the desired temperature is reached.

Let's see how this goes!
